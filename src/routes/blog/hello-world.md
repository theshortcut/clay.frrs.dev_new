# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post on my new website built with SvelteKit.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, clean place to share my thoughts and projects. SvelteKit seemed like the perfect choice because:

- It's fast and efficient
- Great developer experience
- Built-in static site generation
- Easy to work with markdown

## What's Next

I'm planning to write about various topics including:

1. Web development
2. Programming tutorials
3. Personal projects
4. Technology trends

Stay tuned for more content!

## Code Example

Here's a simple code snippet just to show that markdown code blocks work:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

Thanks for reading!
